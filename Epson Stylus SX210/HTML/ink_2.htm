<div class="body-text">Read all of the instructions in this section before replacing the ink cartridges.</div>

<div id="itemiz">
<div class="bullet">This printer uses ink cartridges equipped with an IC chip that monitors the amount of ink used by each cartridge. Cartridges are usable even if they are removed and reinserted. </div>

<div class="bullet">Some ink is consumed from all cartridges during the following operations: print head cleaning and ink charging when an ink cartridge is installed.</div>

<div class="bullet">If you need to remove an ink cartridge temporarily, be sure to protect the ink supply area from dirt and dust. Store the ink cartridge in the same environment as the printer. When storing the cartridge, be sure that its label identifying the color of the ink cartridge is facing upward. Do not store ink cartridges upside down.</div>

<div class="bullet">The valve in the ink supply port is designed to contain any excess ink that may be released. However, careful handling is recommended. Do not touch the supply port of the ink cartridge or its surrounding area.</div>

<div class="bullet">For maximum ink efficiency, only remove an ink cartridge when you are ready to replace it. Ink cartridges with low ink status may not be used when reinserted.</div>

<div class="bullet">Other products not manufactured by Epson may cause damage that is not covered by Epson&rsquo;s warranties, and under certain circumstances, may cause erratic printer behavior.</div>

<div class="bullet">Keep ink cartridges out of the reach of children. Do not allow children to drink from or handle the cartridges.</div>

<div class="bullet">Be careful when you handle used ink cartridges, as there may be some ink around the ink supply port. If ink gets on your skin, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. If ink gets into your eyes, flush them immediately with water. If discomfort or vision problems continue after a thorough flushing, see a doctor immediately.</div>

<div class="bullet">Epson recommends the use of genuine Epson ink cartridges. Epson cannot guarantee the quality or reliability of non-genuine ink. The use of non-genuine ink may cause damage that is not covered by Epson&rsquo;s warranties, and under certain circumstances, may cause erratic printer behavior. Information about non-genuine ink levels may not be displayed, and use of non-genuine ink is recorded for possible use in service support.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not open the ink cartridge package until you are ready to install it in the printer. The cartridge is vacuum packed to maintain its reliability.</div>

<div class="bullet">Leave the old cartridge installed in the printer until you have obtained a replacement; otherwise, ink remaining in the print head nozzles may dry out.</div>

<div class="bullet">You cannot continue printing with one ink cartridge expended, even if the other cartridges still contain ink. Before printing, replace the expended cartridge.</div>
