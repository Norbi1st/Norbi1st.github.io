<div class="body-text">Read all of the instructions in this section before using the printer. Also, be sure to follow all warnings and instructions marked on the printer.</div>







<h2 class="head-b">
<a name="S-00300-00100-00100"></a>Setting up the printer</h2>

<div class="body-text">Observe the following when setting up the printer:</div>

<div id="itemiz">
<div class="bullet">Do not block or cover the vents and openings in the printer.</div>

<div class="bullet">Use only the type of power source indicated on the printer&rsquo;s label.</div>

<div class="bullet">Use only the power cord that comes with the printer. Use of another cord may result in fire or electric shock.</div>

<div class="bullet">The printer&rsquo;s power cord is for use with the printer only. Use with other equipment may result in fire or electric shock.</div>

<div class="bullet">Be sure your AC power cord meets the relevant local safety standard.</div>

<div class="bullet">Avoid using outlets on the same circuit as photocopiers or air control systems that regularly switch on and off.</div>

<div class="bullet">Avoid electrical outlets controlled by wall switches or automatic timers.</div>

<div class="bullet">Keep the entire computer system away from potential sources of electromagnetic interference, such as loudspeakers or the base units of cordless telephones.</div>

<div class="bullet">The power-supply cords should be placed to avoid abrasions, cuts, fraying, crimping, and kinking. Do not place objects on top of the power-supply cords and do not allow the power-supply cords to be stepped on or run over. Be particularly careful to keep all the power-supply cords straight at the ends and the points where they enter and leave the transformer.</div>

<div class="bullet">If you use an extension cord with the printer, make sure that the total ampere rating of the devices plugged into the extension cord does not exceed the cord&rsquo;s ampere rating. Also, make sure that the total ampere rating of all devices plugged into the wall outlet does not exceed the wall outlet&rsquo;s ampere rating.</div>

<div class="bullet">Never disassemble, modify, or attempt to repair the power cord, printer unit, scanner unit, or options by yourself, except as specifically explained in the printer&rsquo;s guides.</div>

<div class="bullet">Unplug the printer and refer servicing to qualified service personnel under the following conditions:<br>The power cord or plug is damaged; liquid has entered the printer; the printer has been dropped or the casing damaged; the printer does not operate normally or exhibits a distinct change in performance. Do not adjust controls that are not covered by the operating instructions.</div>

<div class="bullet">If you plan to use the printer in Germany, the building installation must be protected by a 10 or 16 amp circuit breaker to provide adequate short-circuit protection and over-current protection for the printer.</div>

<div class="bullet">When connecting the printer to a computer or other device with a cable, ensure the correct orientation of the connectors. Each connector has only one correct orientation. Inserting a connector in the wrong orientation may damage both devices connected by the cable.</div>

<div class="bullet">If damage occurs to the plug, replace the cord set or consult a qualified electrician. If there are fuses in the plug, make sure you replace them with fuses of the correct size and rating.</div>

<h2 class="head-b">
<a name="S-00300-00100-00200"></a>Choosing a place for the printer</h2>

<div class="body-text">Observe the following when choosing a place for the printer:</div>

<div id="itemiz">
<div class="bullet">Place the printer on a flat, stable surface that extends beyond the base of the printer in all directions. If you place the printer by the wall, leave more than 10 cm between the back of the printer and the wall. The printer will not operate properly if it is tilted at an angle.</div>

<div class="bullet">When storing or transporting the printer, do not tilt it, stand it on its side, or turn it upside down. Otherwise, ink may leak from the cartridges.</div>

<div class="bullet">Allow spaces behind the printer for the cables, and space above the printer so that you can fully raise the document cover.</div>

<div class="bullet">Avoid places subject to rapid changes in temperature and humidity. Also, keep the printer away from direct sunlight, strong light, or heat sources.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not place or store the printer outdoors, near excessive dirt or dust, water, heat sources, or in locations subject to shocks, vibrations, high temperature or humidity. Do not use with wet hands.</div>

<div class="bullet">Place the printer near a wall outlet where the plug can be easily unplugged.</div>

<h2 class="head-b">
<a name="S-00300-00100-00300"></a>Using the printer</h2>

<div class="body-text">Observe the following when using the printer:</div>

<div id="itemiz">
<div class="bullet">Do not insert objects through the slots in the printer.</div>

<div class="bullet">Take care not to spill liquid on the printer.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not put your hand inside the printer or touch the ink cartridges during printing.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not touch the white flat cable inside the printer.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not use aerosol products that contain flammable gases inside or around this printer. Doing so may cause fire.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not move the print head by hand; otherwise, you may damage the printer.</div>

<div class="bullet">Always turn the printer off using the <img border="0" src="files/fon3_80.gif"> <b>On</b> button. Do not unplug the printer or turn off the power at the outlet until the LCD panel has turned off completely.</div>

<div class="bullet">Before transporting the printer, make sure that the print head is in the home (far right) position and the ink cartridges are in place.</div>

<div class="bullet">Leave the ink cartridges installed. Removing the cartridges can dehydrate the print head and may prevent the printer from printing.</div>

<div class="bullet">Be careful not to trap your fingers when closing the scanner unit.</div>

<div class="bullet">If you are not going to use the printer for a long period, be sure to unplug the power cord from the electrical outlet.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not press too hard on the document table when placing the originals.</div>

<h2 class="head-b">
<a name="S-00300-00100-00400"></a>Handling ink cartridges</h2>

<div class="body-text">Observe the following when handling the ink cartridges:</div>

<div id="itemiz">
<div class="bullet">Keep ink cartridges out of the reach of children. Do not allow children to drink from or handle the cartridges.</div>

<div class="bullet">Shake new ink cartridges four or five times before opening their packages.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not shake ink cartridges after opening their packages; this can cause leakage.</div>

<div class="bullet">Be careful when you handle used ink cartridges, as there may be some ink remaining around the ink supply port. If ink gets on your skin, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. If ink gets into your eyes, flush them immediately with water. If discomfort or vision problems remain after a thorough flushing, see a doctor immediately.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not remove or tear the label on the cartridge; this can cause leakage.</div>

<div class="bullet">Install the ink cartridge immediately after you remove it from its package. If you leave a cartridge unpacked for a long time before using it, normal printing may not be possible.</div>

<div class="bullet">Use the ink cartridge before the date printed on its package.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not disassemble or remodel the ink cartridge, otherwise you may not be able to print normally.</div>

<div class="bullet">After bringing an ink cartridge inside from a cold storage site, allow it to warm up at room temperature for at least three hours before using it.</div>

<div class="bullet">Store ink cartridges in a cool, dark place.</div>

<div class="bullet">Do not touch the green IC chip on the side of the cartridge. Doing so may prevent normal operation and printing.</div>

<div class="bullet">If you remove an ink cartridge for later use, protect the ink supply area from dirt and dust, and store it in the same environment as the printer. A valve in the ink supply port makes covers or plugs unnecessary, but the ink may stain items that come into contact with this area of the cartridge. Do not touch the ink supply port or the surrounding area.</div>

<div class="bullet">Store ink cartridges with their labels facing upward. Do not store cartridges upside down.</div>

<h2 class="head-b">
<a name="S-00300-00100-00500"></a>Using memory cards</h2>

<div id="itemiz">
<div class="bullet">Do not remove a memory card or turn off the printer while the memory card light is flashing.</div>

<div class="bullet">The methods for using memory cards vary according to card type. Be sure to refer to the documentation packaged with your memory card for details.</div>

<div class="bullet">Use only memory cards compatible with the printer.<br>

<h2 class="head-b">
<a name="S-00300-00100-00600"></a>Using the LCD screen</h2>

<div id="itemiz">
<div class="bullet">The LCD screen may contain a few small bright or dark spots, and because of its features it may have an uneven brightness. These are normal and do not indicate that it is damaged in any way.</div>

<div class="bullet">Only use a dry, soft cloth to clean the LCD screen. Do not use liquid or chemical cleansers.</div>

<div class="bullet">If the LCD screen is damaged, contact your dealer. If the liquid crystal solution gets on your hands, wash them thoroughly with soap and water. If the liquid crystal solution gets into your eyes, flush them immediately with water. If discomfort or vision problems remain after a thorough flushing, see a doctor immediately.</div>
